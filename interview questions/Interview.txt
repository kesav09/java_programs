-39. Given two (dictionary) words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two words are called isomorphic if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of it with another letter while the ordering of the letters remains unchanged. No two letters may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself.
-
-Example:
-Given "foo", "app"; returns true
-   we can map 'f' -> 'a' and 'o' -> 'p'
-Given "bar", "foo"; returns false
-   we can't map both 'a' and 'r' to 'o'
-
-Given "turtle", "tletur"; returns true
-   we can map 't' -> 't', 'u' -> 'l', 'r' -> 'e', 'l' -> 'u', 'e' -'r'
-
-Given "ab", "ca"; returns true
-   we can map 'a' -> 'c', 'b'

-	2nd round Phone Technical:
-	Given a sorted array with duplicates and a number, find the range in the
-	form of (startIndex, endIndex) of that number. For example,
-
-	find_range({0 2 3 3 3 10 10}, 3) should return (2,4).
-	find_range({0 2 3 3 3 10 10}, 6) should return (-1,-1).
-	The array and the number of duplicates can be large.

-59. searching in a matrix sorted row wise
-60. exponent of a number
-61. Consider an X x Y array of 1's and 0s. The X axis represents "influences" meaning that X influences Y. So, for example, if $array[3,7] is 1 that means that 3 influences 7.
-
-An "influencer" is someone who influences every other person, but is not influenced by any other member.
-
-Given such an array, write a function to determine whether or not an "influencer" exists in the array.
