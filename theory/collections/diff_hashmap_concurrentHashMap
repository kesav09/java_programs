- hashmap is not synchronized, concurrent hashmap is.
- to synchronize hashmap we can do Map<K,V> map = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashmap); 
	- this is similar to hashtable
	- lock is applied on the whole map object when making changes to the map.
	
	To create concurrentHashMap, ConcurrentHashMap<K,V> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<K,V>();
		- concurrentHashMap uses synchronized block, so only some parts of the code are synchronized for better performance. 
			sync. hashmap would put lock on the whole map object.
