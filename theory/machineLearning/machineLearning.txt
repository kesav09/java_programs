machine learning definition: 
	- gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
	- computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

machine learning algorithms
	- SUPERVISED learning (mostly used)
	- UNSUPERVISED learning (mostly used)
	- reinforcement learning
	- recommender systems
	- example: housing prices (sq.ft. vs price) predict the price for house for a specific sq. ft. with data given.
 
supervised learning:
	- giving right answers to predict.
	- REGRESSION problem - uses a range of values. predict the real valued output.
		-- example: housing prices (sq.ft. vs price) predict the price for house for a specific sq. ft. with data given.
	- CLASSIFICATION problem - Discrete valued output (0 or 1). Fixed set of output values.
		-- example: email spam or not spam problem 
	- we use a set of different features as an input to the model.
	
unsupervised learning a.k.a clustering algorithm.
	- huge unstructured dataset is given, we need to structure that data by forming clusters.
		-- example: organize computing clusters, social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.
		-- example: - given a set of web nes articles, group them into set of articles of the same story.
					- given a database of customer data
